# Weather-Dashboard

For this assignment, we were instructed to create a weather app, pulling information from the OpenWeather API. The user needed to be able to search a city, see the current conditions, and a 5-day forecast. There also needs to be a search history that will bring back (refreshed) results. Upon refresh, last searched results will appear.


## User Story
