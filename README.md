# Weather-Dashboard

For this assignment, we were instructed to create a weather app, pulling information from the OpenWeather API. The user needed to be able to search a city, see the current date's conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, uv index), and a 5-day forecast. There also needs to be a search history that will bring back (refreshed) results. Upon click of each button, that city's updated results will appear.
